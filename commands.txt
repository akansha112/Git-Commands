Hi Everyone...
Here are some Git commands everyone should know while working with Git.

Done with installing of git,
We have to open git bash and this is the terminal where we will write all our commands.
 
For the first time when ope the git bash terminal,
we have to set our configurations.

global config --global user.name "your_username_here"
global config --global user.email "your_email_here"

**To check our configuation**
git config --global --edit

--To make the directory
mkdir "your_directory_name"

--To check the present working directory
pwd

--To list down all the files in the directory
ls

--To go in the directory
cd "your_directory_name"

--To make your directory a git directory
git init

--To check hidden folders
ls -a

--To make a file in a directory
touch "your_file_name"
eg- touch sample.txt

--To write inside the file
vi "your_file_name"
